# Remote Label Designer for Home Automation

When you start using physical remotes with Home Assistant (Hue, IKEA, Aqara, …), you quickly assign more actions than the manufacturer ever intended: single press, double press, long press.

After a while, you simply forget what does what.

Labeling sounds trivial – but paper stickers don’t last, and designing consistent labels in a graphics tool is overkill.

This tool generates simple, consistent button labels without requiring any design software.

## What it does (for now)

-   Create button labels for smart-home remotes
-   Export as PNG (300 DPI)
-   Optional print calibration (10 mm reference)
-   No accounts, no cloud, no vendor lock-in

## What it is NOT (yet)

-   No PDF/SVG export
-   No perfect print templates
-   No sticker service (planned later)

## Why PNG first?

The goal is to validate the concept in real life: print it, cut it, stick it on a remote, use it for a few days.

## Feedback wanted

-   Does this solve a real problem for you?
-   Which remotes are missing?
-   Is PNG enough or do you need SVG/PDF?
-   What button sizes do you actually need?

This is an early community prototype. Expect rough edges.
