# Contributing to ha-remote-designer

Thanks for your interest in this project!

This is an early community prototype. The main goal is to validate the idea through real-world usage, not to build a complete or polished product yet.

---

## How you can help most

### 1. Use it in real life

-   Print the labels
-   Stick them on a remote
-   Use them for a few days

Real usage feedback is more valuable than code.

---

### 2. Open issues

Issues are the preferred way to contribute.

Helpful issues include:

-   missing remotes or button sizes
-   printing or scaling problems
-   usability issues
-   photos of real remotes with labels applied

---

### 3. Feature requests

Feature ideas are welcome, but please understand:

-   not everything will be implemented
-   simplicity is intentional
-   higher-end exports (PDF/SVG) are explicitly out of scope for now

---

## Pull Requests

Please open an issue **before** submitting a pull request.

At this stage:

-   conceptual discussion > implementation
-   small, focused changes are preferred
-   large refactors will likely be rejected

This may change as the project matures.

---

## Scope and expectations

This project aims to stay:

-   simple
-   tool-focused
-   vendor-agnostic

It is **not** intended to become a full design or print pipeline.

Thanks for helping shape this project.
